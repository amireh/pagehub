## Cookies and nuts

Welcome to your PageHub Notebook. The text that you see here is inside the **editor**
which is where you can write your pages. Click anywhere on this text to instantly
edit it.

## Page listings

To the left &larr; you can see a listing of your pages:

* to create a new one, simply click the `New` link at the top of the list
* to edit a page's title, click its title once you've started editing it

The page you're currently editing is highlighted in the list.

## Page actions

What you see above &uarr; is the *page action bar*. These links will be greyed out until
you start editing a page. Move your mouse cursor over them to get an explanation
of what they do.

## Markup &amp; styling your documents

PageHub uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for "styling"
documents. There are many advantages to using Markdown:

1. your documents can be viewed in a perfectly readable way in *any* plain text editor
2. while editing, you get to focus on the *content* of your documents instead of its formatting
3. you can still get a pretty version of the document with "real" formatting in clean, valid HTML pages!

Okay, now you're sold on using Markdown, but how do you do that? Check out this [reference sheet](http://pagehub.mxvt.net/markdown-cheatsheet) that gives you the most common editing features you could need. For a full reference of Markdown's capabilities, see the link above.
