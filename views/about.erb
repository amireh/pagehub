## About PageHub

PageHub is built using Ruby and [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com).
The Markdown rendering is done using [RedCarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet)
by [GitHub](http://github.com) and their 
[flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/). 
[CodeMirror](http://www.codemirror.net) drives the JavaScript code editor that you get to write in.

## Browser Compatibility

A decent and updated browser is needed to use PageHub as it uses HTML5 and CSS3.
It has been tested on Windows, Mac, and Linux using Google Chrome, Firefox (7.0 to 14.0.1),
Safari 5, Opera 12.0.1 (with limited success), and IE9/10.
