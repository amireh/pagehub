## Document embedding

  > Embed external documents *inside* the pages that you
  > write; snippets of code, GitHub Wiki content, documentation, etc.
  > Embedding will relieve you of the trouble of maintaining
  > all documents that reference each other when one
  > gets updated.

## Table of Content generation

  > The [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
  > renderer is extended to support generating a ToC
  > for your pages. And it's dead simple:
  >
  > `[!toc!]`

## Folders, projects, spaces - you name it

  > Group up your documents within a - technically infinite -
  > hierarchy of folders that are presented to people in a
  > linked, Wiki-like way. [Read more](http://pagehub.org/pagehub/features/folders)
  > about folder support.

## Version control

  > All your pages are revisioned and you can roll back to any
  > revision snapshot at any time, as well as view the changes
  > between each revision along with their author.

## Group support

  > Aside of your own personal space of pages, you can create
  > groups where any number of people can collaboratively create,
  > edit, review, and share pages.

## **Keybindings**
  
  > Actions that you'll do regularly such as saving and
  > previewing can be quickly done using 
  > [keybindings](http://www.pagehub.org/pagehub/keybindings).

## **Customizable everything**

  > PageHub offers several built-in themes for the rendered
  > versions of your pages. It also lets you customize things
  > like text justification, the page width, etc.
  >
  > The editor is also customizable in its font face,
  > size, and line-height.

## **Autosaving**

  > Every 30 seconds as you're editing a page, PageHub will
  > automatically save it for you. It's even smart enough to
  > remember how you left each folder; collapsed or not.

## **Syntax highlighting**
  
  > Thanks to [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net) being awesome, 
  > the editor supports real-time highlighting of the Markdown you
  > write as well as, to an extent, code written in other languages.
  >
  > Rendered versions also include a syntax formatter and highlighter.

## **Public sharing**

  > You can choose to share a page by generating a publicly
  > visible link.

## It's Open-Source!

  > You can check out the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/amireh/pagehub)
  > and host it yourself if you'd like to. PageHub is currently
  > hosted on my own personal server and would probably not be 
  > able to hold much traffic.

And here's what's planned for future revisions:

  * Syncing from git repositories and local documents for offline editing
  * Collaborative editing
