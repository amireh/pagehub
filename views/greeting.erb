  PageHub - An online Markdown text editor
<% end %>

<%= md <<-EOF

## What it is

[PageHub](www.pagehub.org) is an online text editor that makes
taking notes as well as writing technical documents a snap. The pages you create on
[PageHub](www.pagehub.org) can be shared with other people, or be kept
private to yourself.

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is used by PageHub as
the editing format, and if you haven't used it before, you will have to spend 
several minutes to learn how to write documents using it. But don't worry, it's
easy, and once you get into it, you'll never want to go back!

## Features

  * **Instantly** write what you need to write without having to worry about
    titles, URLs, or navigating a complicated interface
  * Look up your documents easily
  * Engage the "pretty" mode and transform your plain documents into
    **beautiful** HTML pages
  * Customize the looks of the pages you share with people
  * **Embed** documents inside others; no longer will you need to
    maintain multiple versions of documents that reference each other
  * Utilize the keyboard; [PageHub](www.pagehub.org) is equipped with keybindings
    for common operations

You can check out the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/amireh/pagehub)
and host it yourself if you'd like to. PageHub is currently hosted on my
own personal server and would probably not be able to hold much traffic.
