Welcome to your PageHub space. The text that you see here is inside the **editor** which is where you can write your pages. Click anywhere on this text to instantly edit it.

## Page listings

To the left &larr; you can see a listing of your pages and folders:

* to create a new one, simply click the `New` &rarr; `New page` link at the top of the list (or `Ctrl+Alt+C`)
* to edit a page's title, click its title once you've started editing it

The page you're currently editing is highlighted in the list.

## Page actions

What you see above &uarr; is the *page action bar*. These links will be greyed out until you start editing a page. Move your mouse cursor over them to get an explanation of what they do.

## Markup &amp; styling your documents

PageHub uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for "styling" documents. To learn how to use Markdown, there are links in  the Help listing (up in the top &uarr;) that can get you cooking.

## Stay aware

The first link in the Help listing takes you to the PageHub news article, you should check it out every once in a while to learn about new features you can leverage.
